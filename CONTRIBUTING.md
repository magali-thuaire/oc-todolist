# Welcome to ToDoList App docs contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments).  

If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a [new issue](https://github.com/magali-thuaire/oc-todolist/issues/new).

## Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/magali-thuaire/oc-todolist/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, we don‚Äôt assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Create a new branch

Create a branch for your contribution, taking care to name it in a coherent and understandable way (in English preferably).

### Test your changes

**Run the tests**

Verify that they always pass after your changes:

```
symfony run bin/phpunit
```

**Update coverage**

Update the coverage test file, with the following command:

```
symfony run bin/phpunit --coverage-html tests/test-coverage
```

Don't forget to commit this new tests/coverage.xml file!

### Coding conventions

The project follows the good practices of PSR-1 and PSR-12:

[PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/)  
[PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)

The PHP_CS_fixer and PHP_Codesniffer libraries are present in the project to help you to respect good development practices.
